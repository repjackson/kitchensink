currency has to be scarce
creating a doc costs a point?
no automatic upvote, upvote can only be from other users,
every post is a risk
no, you can post as much as you like
every upvote is a tip, each user starts with 100
then you can sell stuff for fixed amount, like 20 points because no inflation
this is critical, no vagueness

everyone starts with 100, can tip author, same amount goes to post?
what's real world version, see street performer, give tip, not gift card, just tip author, then no ambiguity with where points are going, just one number, so encourages to get points creating cool stuff, then can buy
then comparison only comes from authored posts, not upvoted or tipped

eliminate doc cost?
just receive tips, then anyone can buy, then doc just shows user tips common
so it's a flow, tipping someone is irreversible?  like cash, think cash dude
simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

if docs don't have points then docs are ranked by person points?
but those fluctuate.  So docs can have a donation history that rank them.  And user points move around.  So quality control and the economy?

Maybe, sounds compelling.

Does sending have to be irreversible?  Like giving a dollar.  Then what if the person changes the document/deletes it.  Think game.

Get points

Subscription model: $1/month, gives you 100 points

Purchase model:
    $11 gets you 1000 points
    Cash out: 1000 points pays you $9
    Start with 100 points
    Document creation is free.  Users can tip each other 1 point (1 cent)
    Allows money making.


Todo:
-combine send/retrieve point with upvote/downvote
-remove cost and buying features
